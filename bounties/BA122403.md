## Summary 
Write OpenAPI 3.x specifications for the HTTP API endpoints smartnode v2 currently uses.

## Required Milestones

### Milestone A - Initial OpenAPI Specification Integration
**Payout:** $500 
* Start small- write a spec for a single endpoint and complete the migration of that entire endpoint/client. Add CI jobs to ensure that the generated code is always ‘fresh’ on merge.
* Add additional endpoints one by one until they are all migrated to spec-driven.
* Confine all the generated code to a single go package that only contains generated code.
* All HTTP endpoints and client code should be through the generated interfaces.
* A OpenAPI spec has been added and its generated code is being used by one API endpoint.
* A script has been added that runs codegen.
* A Github Actions CI job has been added and verifies that re-running codegen produces no diff.
* Generate middleware using https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen.
* Migrate Smart Node v2’s raw HTTP serving to use the generated code instead.

### Milestone B - Complete OpenAPI Specification Implementation
**Payout: ** $3,000 
* All API endpoints are in the spec
* All API endpoints and client code uses generated interfaces.

## Further Notes
* Recommend familiarity with Golang, OpenAPI/Swagger, the HTTP protocol, and REST principles.
* This is not a good first bounty. It will be very difficult if it is your first contribution.

## Verification
* Smart Node’s current maintainers can confirm completion.
