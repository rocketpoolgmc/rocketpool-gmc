## Summary 

Resolve one or more of four specific issues on the Smartnode GitHub repository. This bounty includes only the four issues described in the milestones below. 

## Milestones

These milestones may be completed individually, in any order, or by separate bounty hunters.

### Milestone B - Issue #438
**Payout:** $1000  

[Networks should not be hard-coded](https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode/issues/438)
* Submit a pull request to the Smartnode repository that resolves issue #438.
* You must test the new functionality thoroughly before submitting the PR. 
* Your PR must be merged into the repository by a member of the Rocket Pool core team and this issue closed as completed.
* Check in with Patches first to discuss your solution before starting work. 

## Further Notes

* [Correct rocketpool_node approximate rpl reward panel for RPIP-30 changes](https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode/issues/439)
  * This will make the “Approx. RPL at Next Checkpoint” metrics more accurate for RPIP-30
* [Networks should not be hard-coded](https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode/issues/438)
  * This will make smartnode maintenance easier by adding a networks.yml file that makes it easy to add and remove networks (such as deprecating goerli/prater). Currently changing the supported smartnode networks requires changing the binary.
* [[bug] Watchtower fails to fall back to archive EC in generateRewardsTree when primary ec isn't useful](https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode/issues/397)
  * This will improve oDAO treegen reliability. The solution is in the ticket, it just needs to get added to the code and tested.
* [Feature Request: rocketpool service prune and rocketpool service reset](https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode/issues/323)
  * These commands are more ergonomic and will make the burden in #support slightly lessened.

## Verification
* A member of the core team will review the contents of your pull requests.
