## Summary 

Incorporate an optional background process into the rocket pool smart node that detects if any of the loaded validators have been slashed and if so stops the VC until a NO override.

## Milestones

These milestones may be completed individually, in any order, or by separate bounty hunters.

### Milestone A - Develop working code
**Payout:** $1000 
Write code that can be incorporated into the smart node that:
* is opt-in, and has no effect on smart node when opted-out
* stops the VC if any loaded validator is detected to be slashed
* requires the NO to give some specific command to restart the VC
* keeps a whitelist of previously slashed validators so these donâ€™t interfere with restarting the VC
* is open source
* low use of system resources
* demonstrated effectiveness on testnet

### Milestone B - Implement working code
**Payout:** $500
* The program doing the above is incorporated into the smart node (will require liasing with the team). If the team does not want to incorporate this idea, this milestone can be fulfilled by having a complementary program for NOs downloadable separately from smart node.

## Further Notes

This bounty should expire on August 1, 2025 if not claimed.

## Verification
* A member of the core team will review the contents of your pull requests.  
* Please contact the GMC Administrator to arrange these reviews once you have completed a milestone and created a Pull Request.
