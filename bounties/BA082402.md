## Summary
Create a non-custodial staking as a service option similar to AllNodes. 

# Eligibility
Team ramana (ramana, Looking For Owls), and NeverAnIsland are eligible for this bounty.

## Required Milestones

### Milestone B - Working Product
**Payout:** $20,000  

* You must provide evidence of a functioning product.
* The product must be meet the the specification requirements laid out in Milestone A.
* The product must have at least 10 users using the Rocket Pool contracts.
* The product must have at least 100 minipools as defined in the Rocket Pool contracts.
* Must be completed by the same party to complete Milestone A, unless that party has explicitly granted consent for completion by another party.
* Must be achieved by September 1, 2024.

### Milestone C - Scaling
**Payout:** $60,000  

* You must provide evidence of a functioning and scalable product.
* The product must be meet the the specification requirements laid out in Milestone A.
* Block proposals made by users of the Rocket Pool contracts within the product must exceed 5% of the proposals made by users of Allnode's Rocket Pool service over the period of a week. 
* Must be completed within six months of the completion of milestone A.
* Must be completed by the same party to complete Milestone A, unless that party has explicitly granted consent for completion by another party.
* Must be achieved by March 1, 2025.

## Further Notes

The service need not be identifical to AllNodes. For example, it could require running something very lightweight on a home computer, which could be run on a primary machine (as opposed to dedicated hardware).

## Updates

* 2024-03-05 - Both team ramana (ramana, Looking For Owls) and NeverAnIsland are eligible for the remaining milestones, and upon completion, they will share the award. However, if only one project reaches completion, it will receive the entire award.
* 2024-02-17 - Team ramana (ramana, Looking For Owls), and NeverAnIsland complete milestone A to deliver a full product specification. They both are eligible for the full award of milestone A.

## Verification
* The GMC must approve each milestone.
* Please contact the GMC Administrator to arrange review of each milestone as it is completed.
